## A Structured Journey Through TypeScript Learning

Welcome to `Sameer_TypeScript_Progress`! This repository documents my personal learning journey and revision process for TypeScript. It's designed to be a structured resource, organized day-by-day, covering fundamental to advanced TypeScript concepts. Whether you're a beginner looking to start with TypeScript or an experienced developer wanting to refresh your knowledge, this repository aims to provide clear, concise examples and practical exercises.

## Why This Repository?

As an automation engineer, understanding TypeScript is crucial for building robust and scalable test frameworks, especially with modern web technologies. This repository serves multiple purposes:

*   **Personal Learning Log**: A chronological record of my progress and understanding of various TypeScript topics.
*   **Educational Resource**: Each folder represents a day's learning or a specific concept, making it easy for others to follow along.
*   **Practical Examples**: Contains code examples and assignments to solidify understanding.
*   **Revision Aid**: A quick reference for revisiting concepts and reinforcing knowledge.

## How to Use This Repository for Learning

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sameer-Programmer/Sameer_TypeScript_Progress.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate by Day**: Each `DayX` folder represents a progression in learning. It's recommended to go through them sequentially.
3.  **Review Code Examples**: Inside each day's folder, you'll find `.ts` files with code examples demonstrating the concepts.
4.  **Tackle Assignments**: The `Assignments` folders contain exercises to test your understanding. Try to solve them before looking at potential solutions (if provided).
5.  **Experiment**: Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different approaches, and break things to understand them better.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this repository, you should have:

*   Basic understanding of JavaScript.
*   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
*   A code editor (like VS Code) with TypeScript support.

## Setup

1.  **Install TypeScript**: If you don't have TypeScript installed globally, you can do so:
    ```bash
    npm install -g typescript
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the root of the cloned repository and install any project-specific dependencies (if `package.json` exists and has dependencies):
    ```bash
    cd Sameer_TypeScript_Progress
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Compile and Run**: To compile a TypeScript file (e.g., `Day1/hello.ts`) and run it:
    ```bash
    tsc Day1/hello.ts
    node Day1/hello.js
    ```

## Contributing (to your own learning!)

This is primarily a personal progress repository. However, you can contribute to your own learning by:

*   Adding more detailed notes to the files.
*   Creating new examples for concepts you find challenging.
*   Refactoring existing code for better readability or efficiency.
*   Adding more assignments and their solutions.

Happy learning!
